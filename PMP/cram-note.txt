Project Management Terms

Project:
  - A temporary endeavor that produces a unique product, service, or result.
  - temporary in nature and has a definite beginning and ending
 
Operation Management:
  - Deals with the ongoing production of goods and/or Services
  - Considers the acquisition, development, and utilization of resources that firms need to deliver the goods and services

Project Management:
  - is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to satisfy project requirements.
    + Preparing a business case to justify the investment.
    + Estimating resources and times
    + Developing and implementing a management plan for the project.
    + Leading and motivating the project delivery team.
    + Managing the risks, issues, and changes on the project
    + Monitoring progress against plan
    + Closing the project in a controlled fashion when approriate

-------
Program Management:
  - Group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available from managing them individually.
    + Must be some value add in managing them together as a program.
    + A project may or may not be part of a program, but a program will always have projects. 

Portfolio Management:
  - is a collection of projects, programs, subsidiary porfolios, and operations managed as a group to achieve strategic objectives.
    + Collections of Projects, Programs, subsidiarity Portfolios.
    + Achieve strategic (long term) objectives.

Remember:
  - A program is a collection of projects.
  - A portfolio is a collection of projects and programs.

-------
Value of Projects:
  - What values will this project bring to the company upon completion?
  - Why should we undertake this project?
  - Money, Brand reputation, Customer Service, New or Change product or Service

Projects enable changes:
  - Project can be a vehicle for change in an organization.
  - Takes a company form a current state to desired state

-------
Phases:
  - is a collection of logically related project activities that culminates in the conmpletion of one or more deliverables.
    + The number of the phases depends on the industry type and size and the complixity of the project.

Deliverables:
  - is any unique and verifiable product, service or result.
    + May be tangiable or intangible.
    + Must be accepted by the customer or sponsor for the phase

Remember:
  - Phases and number of phases is determined by project manager.
  - A phase will output a deliverable.

-------
Project Life cycle:
  - A representation of the phases that a project typically goes through from start to finish.
  - Can be either predictive or adaptive or hybrid.

There are 3 kinds of the Project life cycles:
  - Predictive project (aka Plan-Driven, Traditional project)
  - Change-Driven (aka Agile method): includes things like iterative, incremental and adaptive.
  - Hybrid: combination between 2 above methods.

Remember: 
  - The project lifecycle are all the phases that we go through on the project.
  - They could be managed in basically on of three ways either predictive, agile, or hybrid.

--------
Stakeholders:
  - Individuals, groups, or organization that may affect, be affected, or perceive to be affected by the project.

Key stakeholders:
  - Project Manager: manages the project.
  - Customer: uses the project deliverable.
  - Project team: the collection of individuals completing the project work
  - Project sponsor: Provides resources and support
  - Functional Manager: Department Manager (i.e Manager of Engineering, Vice President of Marketin, Director of IT) generally controls resources.

--------
Organizational Struct Chanrt
Functional Business:
  - Project Manager: has Little/No power (actually not a project manager)
  - Resource Available: Little/No
  - Budget controls: Functional Manager
  - PM role: Part time
  - PM staff: Part time
=> in this functional business, the functional manager manages everything in the business. The project manager is basically a resource to the functional manager. Functional Manager controls all the budget and they manage all the resources.

Projectized Business (opposite to the Functional Business):
  - Project Manager: High/Total
  - Resource Available: High/Total
  - Budget controls: Project Manager
  - PM role: Full time
  - PM staff: Full time

Matrix:
Weak Matrix:
  - Project Manager: Low
  - Resource Available: Low
  - Budget controls: Functional Manager
  - PM role: Part time
  - PM staff: Part time
Balance Matrix:
  - Project Manager: Low to Moderate
  - Resource Available: Low to Moderate
  - Budget controls: Mixed
  - PM role: Part time / Full time
  - PM staff: Part time / Full time
Strong Matrix:
  - Project Manager: Moderate to High
  - Resource Available: Moderate to High
  - Budget controls: Project Manager
  - PM role: Full time
  - PM staff: Full time

Remember: 
  - a lot of organizations have hybrid structures. Ex: in the research and development department, they are may be project ties, but in the sales department, they are may be functional. In the accouting department, they may have more of a balance metrix. Maybe in the IT department, they may have a balance matrix.
  - Structure of the business determines the power of PM in that business.

---------
Project Management Office (PMO)
  - Organizational Structure that standardizes the processes and facilitates the sharing of resources, methologies, tools, and techniques.
  - Types:
    + Supportive: Supports the project manager, susch as providing templates, training, or lessons learned form other projects.
    + Controlling: Determines the framework or methodology and use of specific forms.
    + Directive: Controls the project. PM will be assigned and report to the PMO.

---------
Constraints
  - limited things we have to control when work in the project
Project constrains (6 constrains): 
  - Scope
  - Schedule
  - Cost
  - Risk
  - Quality
  - Resources

---------
Project Management Approaches
2 primary approaches:
  - Predictive Approach (Traditional or Waterfall): The predictive approach follows a linear and sequential process
    + It involves detailed plaining and documentation upfront, with a focus on predicting and defining the project scope, objectives, timeline, and deliverables.
    + Extensive upfront plaining.
    + Sequential execution.
    + Emphasis on control and documentation.
    + Limited flexibility, limited changes with a well define change control process.
  - Adaptive Approach: focuses on flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development.
    + It embraces change throughout the project and emphasize continuous feedback and improvement.
    + Iterative and incremental development.
    + Customer collaboration.
    + Emphasis on adaptability.
    + Self-organizing teams.
    + The adaptive approach, commonly used in agile methologies like Scrum or Kanban.

Remember:
  - Predictive approach: follow linear set of steps. Scope doesn't really change as the project is getting done. You have a strenuous change control process.
  + Adaptive approach: the scope is changing as time in progressing and you're welcome and changes on an agile project.

----------
Risks vs Issues

Risks: are potential events or situations that may occur in the future and have an impact on the project's success.

Issues: refer to problems or challenges that arise during the course of a project. They are typically negative events or circumstances that hinder process or impact project objective.

Remember:
  - Risk is something that could potentially affect your project.
  - Issue is something that is affecting your project.

---------
Leadership vs Management

Management:
  - Direct using positional power
  - Maintain
  - Administrate

  - It involves being aware of one's own emotions, effectively handling them, empathizing with others, and using emotions to guide thinking and behavior.
  - In project management, EQ plays a significan role

----------
Project management principles and domains

Project management principles (12 principles)
  - Principles serves as foundational guidelines for strategy, decision making, and problem solving.
  - Professional standards and methodologies are often based on principles.
  - Principles for project management provide guidance for the behavior of people involved in projects.

Project vs General Management Principles
  - Principles of project management can also have areas of overlap with general management principles

12 Principles:

  2. Create a collaborative project team environment
    - Team
      + Project teams are made up of individuals who wield diverse skills, knowledge, and experience. Project teams that work collaboratively can accomplish a shared objective more effectively and efficiently than individuals working on their own.
        - Projects can delivered by project teams.
        - Project teams work within organizational and professional cultures and guidelines, often establishing their own "local" culture.
        - A collaborative project team environment facilitates: alignment with other organizational cultures and guidelines, individual and team learning and development, and optimal contributions to deliver desired outcomes.

  3. Effectively engage with stakeholders.
    - Stakeholders
      + Engage stakeholders proactively and to the point needed to contribute to project success and customer satification.
        - Stakeholder influence projects, performance, and outcomes.
        - Project teams serve other stakeholders by engaging with them.
        - Stakeholder engagement proactively advances values delivery.

  2: Work with your team, build an environment that the team can share information, they can collaborate with each other. 
  3. Keep your stakeholders actively involved, keep getting requirements, keep showing things, bring them into the project. Because the more they're involved, the more likely your project is successful.

  4. Focus on value
    - Value
      + Value is the worth, importance, or usefulness of something. Value is subjective, in the sense that the same concept can have different value for different people or organizations.
        - Value is the ultimate indicator of project success.
        - Value can be realized throughout the project, at the end of the project, or after the project is complete.
        - Values, and the benefits that contribute to value, can be defined in quantitative and/or qualitative terms.
        - A focus on outcomes allows project teams to support the intended benefits that lead to value creation.

  5. Recognize, evaluate, and respond to system interactions.
    - System thinking
      + Recognize, evaluate, and respond to the dynamic circumstances within and surronding the project in a holistic way to positively affect project performance.
        - A project is a system of interdependent and interacting domains of activity.
        - Systems thinking entails taking a holistic view of how project parts interact with each other and with external systems.
        - Systems are constantly changing, requiring consistent attentions to the internal and external conditions.
        - Being responsive to system interaction allows project team to leverage positive outcomes.

  6. Demonstrate leadership behaviors

        - Effective leaders recognize differences in motivatio n among project team members.
        - Leaders demonstrate desired behavior in areas of honesty, integrity, and ethical conduct.

  7. Tailor based on context
    - Tailor
      + Design the project development methods based on the needs of the project and its objectives, stakeholders, governance, and the environment.
        - Each project is unique
        - Project success is based on adapting to the unique context of the project to determine the most appropriate methods of producing the desired outcomes.
        - Tailoring the approach is iterative, and therefore is a continuous process throughout the project.

  8. Build quality into processes and deliverables
    - Quality
      + Maintain a focus on quality that produces deliverables that meet project objectives and align to the needs, uses, and acceptance requirements set forth by relevant stakeholders.
        - Project quality entails satisfying stakeholders' expectations and fulfilling project and product requirements.
        - Quality focuses on meeting acceptance criteria for deliverables.
        - Project quality entails ensuring project processes are appropriate and as effective as possible.

  9. Navigate complexity
    - Complexity
      + Continually evaluate and natigate project complexity so that approachese and plans enable the project team to successfully navigate the project life cycle.
        - Complexity can emerge at any point during the project.
        - Complexity can be introduced by events or conditions that affect value, scope, communications, stakeholders, risk, and technological innovation.
        - Project teams can stay vigilant in identifying elements of complexity and use a variety of methods to reduce the amount or impact of complexity.

  10. Optimize risk responses
    - Risk
      + Constantly evaluate exposure to risk, both opportunities and threats, to maximize positive impacts and minimize negative impacts to the project ans its outcomes.
        - Individual and overall risks can impact projects.
        - Risks can be positive (opportunities) or negative (threats).
        - Risks are addressed continually throughout the project.
        - An organization's risk attitude, appetite, and threshold influence how risk is addressed.
        - Risk responses should be approriate for the significance of the risk, cost effective, realistic within the project context, agreed to by relevant stakeholders, and owned by a responsble person.

  11. Embrace adaptability and resiliency
    - Adaptability and resiliency
      + Build adaptability and resiliency into the organization's and project team's approaches to help the project accommodate change, recover from setbacks, and advance the work of the project.
        - Adaptability is the ability to respond to changing conditions.
        - Resiliency is the ability to absorb impacts and to recover quickly from a setback or failure.
        - Build adaptability and resiliency into the organization's and project team's approaches.

  12. Enable change to achieve the envisioned future state
    - Change
      + Prepare those impacted for the adoption and sustainment of new and different behaviors and processes required for the transition from the current state to the intended future state created by the project outcomes.
        - A structured approach to change helps individuals, groups, and the organization transition from the current state to a future desired state.
        - Change can originate from internal influences or external sources.
        - Enabling change can be challenging as not all stakeholders embrace change.
        - Attempting too much change in a short time can lead to change fatigue and/or resistance.
        - Stakeholder engagement and motivational approaches assist in change adoption.
