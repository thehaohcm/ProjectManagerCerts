Project Management Terms

Project:
  - A temporary endeavor that produces a unique product, service, or result.
  - temporary in nature and has a definite beginning and ending
 
Operation Management:
  - Deals with the ongoing production of goods and/or Services
  - Considers the acquisition, development, and utilization of resources that firms need to deliver the goods and services

Project Management:
  - is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to satisfy project requirements.
    + Preparing a business case to justify the investment.
    + Estimating resources and times
    + Developing and implementing a management plan for the project.
    + Leading and motivating the project delivery team.
    + Managing the risks, issues, and changes on the project
    + Monitoring progress against plan
    + Closing the project in a controlled fashion when approriate

-------
Program Management:
  - Group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available from managing them individually.
    + Must be some value add in managing them together as a program.
    + A project may or may not be part of a program, but a program will always have projects. 

Portfolio Management:
  - is a collection of projects, programs, subsidiary porfolios, and operations managed as a group to achieve strategic objectives.
    + Collections of Projects, Programs, subsidiarity Portfolios.
    + Achieve strategic (long term) objectives.

Remember:
  - A program is a collection of projects.
  - A portfolio is a collection of projects and programs.

-------
Value of Projects:
  - What values will this project bring to the company upon completion?
  - Why should we undertake this project?
  - Money, Brand reputation, Customer Service, New or Change product or Service

Projects enable changes:
  - Project can be a vehicle for change in an organization.
  - Takes a company form a current state to desired state

-------
Phases:
  - is a collection of logically related project activities that culminates in the conmpletion of one or more deliverables.
    + The number of the phases depends on the industry type and size and the complixity of the project.

Deliverables:
  - is any unique and verifiable product, service or result.
    + May be tangiable or intangible.
    + Must be accepted by the customer or sponsor for the phase

Remember:
  - Phases and number of phases is determined by project manager.
  - A phase will output a deliverable.

-------
Project Life cycle:
  - A representation of the phases that a project typically goes through from start to finish.
  - Can be either predictive or adaptive or hybrid.

There are 3 kinds of the Project life cycles:
  - Predictive project (aka Plan-Driven, Traditional project)
  - Change-Driven (aka Agile method): includes things like iterative, incremental and adaptive.
  - Hybrid: combination between 2 above methods.

Remember: 
  - The project lifecycle are all the phases that we go through on the project.
  - They could be managed in basically on of three ways either predictive, agile, or hybrid.

--------
Stakeholders:
  - Individuals, groups, or organization that may affect, be affected, or perceive to be affected by the project.

Key stakeholders:
  - Project Manager: manages the project.
  - Customer: uses the project deliverable.
  - Project team: the collection of individuals completing the project work
  - Project sponsor: Provides resources and support
  - Functional Manager: Department Manager (i.e Manager of Engineering, Vice President of Marketin, Director of IT) generally controls resources.

--------
Organizational Struct Chanrt
Functional Business:
  - Project Manager: has Little/No power (actually not a project manager)
  - Resource Available: Little/No
  - Budget controls: Functional Manager
  - PM role: Part time
  - PM staff: Part time
=> in this functional business, the functional manager manages everything in the business. The project manager is basically a resource to the functional manager. Functional Manager controls all the budget and they manage all the resources.

Projectized Business (opposite to the Functional Business):
  - Project Manager: High/Total
  - Resource Available: High/Total
  - Budget controls: Project Manager
  - PM role: Full time
  - PM staff: Full time

Matrix:
Weak Matrix:
  - Project Manager: Low
  - Resource Available: Low
  - Budget controls: Functional Manager
  - PM role: Part time
  - PM staff: Part time
Balance Matrix:
  - Project Manager: Low to Moderate
  - Resource Available: Low to Moderate
  - Budget controls: Mixed
  - PM role: Part time / Full time
  - PM staff: Part time / Full time
Strong Matrix:
  - Project Manager: Moderate to High
  - Resource Available: Moderate to High
  - Budget controls: Project Manager
  - PM role: Full time
  - PM staff: Full time

Remember: 
  - a lot of organizations have hybrid structures. Ex: in the research and development department, they are may be project ties, but in the sales department, they are may be functional. In the accouting department, they may have more of a balance metrix. Maybe in the IT department, they may have a balance matrix.
  - Structure of the business determines the power of PM in that business.

---------
Project Management Office (PMO)
  - Organizational Structure that standardizes the processes and facilitates the sharing of resources, methologies, tools, and techniques.
  - Types:
    + Supportive: Supports the project manager, susch as providing templates, training, or lessons learned form other projects.
    + Controlling: Determines the framework or methodology and use of specific forms.
    + Directive: Controls the project. PM will be assigned and report to the PMO.

---------
Constraints
  - limited things we have to control when work in the project
Project constrains (6 constrains): 
  - Scope
  - Schedule
  - Cost
  - Risk
  - Quality
  - Resources

---------
Project Management Approaches
2 primary approaches:
  - Predictive Approach (Traditional or Waterfall): The predictive approach follows a linear and sequential process
    + It involves detailed plaining and documentation upfront, with a focus on predicting and defining the project scope, objectives, timeline, and deliverables.
    + Extensive upfront plaining.
    + Sequential execution.
    + Emphasis on control and documentation.
    + Limited flexibility, limited changes with a well define change control process.
  - Adaptive Approach: focuses on flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development.
    + It embraces change throughout the project and emphasize continuous feedback and improvement.
    + Iterative and incremental development.
    + Customer collaboration.
    + Emphasis on adaptability.
    + Self-organizing teams.
    + The adaptive approach, commonly used in agile methologies like Scrum or Kanban.

Remember:
  - Predictive approach: follow linear set of steps. Scope doesn't really change as the project is getting done. You have a strenuous change control process.
  + Adaptive approach: the scope is changing as time in progressing and you're welcome and changes on an agile project.

----------
Risks vs Issues

Risks: are potential events or situations that may occur in the future and have an impact on the project's success.

Issues: refer to problems or challenges that arise during the course of a project. They are typically negative events or circumstances that hinder process or impact project objective.

Remember:
  - Risk is something that could potentially affect your project.
  - Issue is something that is affecting your project.

---------
Leadership vs Management

Management:
  - Direct using positional power
  - Maintain
  - Administrate
  - Focus on system and structure
  - Rely on control
  - Focus on near-term goles
  - Ask how and when
  - Focus on bottom line
  - Accept status quo

---------
Emotional Intelligence (EQ)

  - Emotional Intelligence refers to the ability of recognize, understand, and manage emotions, both in oneself and in others.
  - It involves being aware of one's own emotions, effectively handling them, empathizing with others, and using emotions to guide thinking and behavior.
  - In project management, EQ plays a significan role

----------
Project management principles and domains

Project management principles (12 principles)
  - Principles serves as foundational guidelines for strategy, decision making, and problem solving.
  - Professional standards and methodologies are often based on principles.
  - Principles for project management provide guidance for the behavior of people involved in projects.

Project vs General Management Principles
  - Principles of project management can also have areas of overlap with general management principles

12 Principles:
  1. Be a Diligent, Respectful, and Caring Steward.
    - Stewardship
      + Stewards act sensibility to carry out actions with integrity, care, and trustworthiness while keeping compliance with internal and external guidelines.
      + They demostrate a broad commitment to finacila, social, and environmental impacts of the projects they support.
      + Stewardship includes: 
        - Integrity
        - Care
        - Trustworthiness
        - Compliance
        - A holistic view of stewardship considers finacial, social, technical, and sustainable environment awareness

  2. Create a collaborative project team environment
    - Team
      + Project teams are made up of individuals who wield diverse skills, knowledge, and experience. Project teams that work collaboratively can accomplish a shared objective more effectively and efficiently than individuals working on their own.
        - Projects can delivered by project teams.
        - Project teams work within organizational and professional cultures and guidelines, often establishing their own "local" culture.
        - A collaborative project team environment facilitates: alignment with other organizational cultures and guidelines, individual and team learning and development, and optimal contributions to deliver desired outcomes.

  3. Effectively engage with stakeholders.
    - Stakeholders
      + Engage stakeholders proactively and to the point needed to contribute to project success and customer satification.
        - Stakeholder influence projects, performance, and outcomes.
        - Project teams serve other stakeholders by engaging with them.
        - Stakeholder engagement proactively advances values delivery.

Remember:
  1. Always be a good steward, be an honest person, have good integrity.
  2: Work with your team, build an environment that the team can share information, they can collaborate with each other. 
  3. Keep your stakeholders actively involved, keep getting requirements, keep showing things, bring them into the project. Because the more they're involved, the more likely your project is successful.

  4. Focus on value
    - Value
      + Value is the worth, importance, or usefulness of something. Value is subjective, in the sense that the same concept can have different value for different people or organizations.
        - Value is the ultimate indicator of project success.
        - Value can be realized throughout the project, at the end of the project, or after the project is complete.
        - Values, and the benefits that contribute to value, can be defined in quantitative and/or qualitative terms.
        - A focus on outcomes allows project teams to support the intended benefits that lead to value creation.

  5. Recognize, evaluate, and respond to system interactions.
    - System thinking
      + Recognize, evaluate, and respond to the dynamic circumstances within and surronding the project in a holistic way to positively affect project performance.
        - A project is a system of interdependent and interacting domains of activity.
        - Systems thinking entails taking a holistic view of how project parts interact with each other and with external systems.
        - Systems are constantly changing, requiring consistent attentions to the internal and external conditions.
        - Being responsive to system interaction allows project team to leverage positive outcomes.

  6. Demonstrate leadership behaviors
    - Leadership
      + Demonstrate and adapt leadership behaviors to support individual and team needs.
        - Effective leadership promotes project success and contributes to positive project outcomes.
        - Any project team member can demonstrate leadership behaviors.
        - Effective leaders adapt their style to the situation.
        - Effective leaders recognize differences in motivatio n among project team members.
        - Leaders demonstrate desired behavior in areas of honesty, integrity, and ethical conduct.

  7. Tailor based on context
    - Tailor
      + Design the project development methods based on the needs of the project and its objectives, stakeholders, governance, and the environment.
        - Each project is unique
        - Project success is based on adapting to the unique context of the project to determine the most appropriate methods of producing the desired outcomes.
        - Tailoring the approach is iterative, and therefore is a continuous process throughout the project.

  8. Build quality into processes and deliverables
    - Quality
      + Maintain a focus on quality that produces deliverables that meet project objectives and align to the needs, uses, and acceptance requirements set forth by relevant stakeholders.
        - Project quality entails satisfying stakeholders' expectations and fulfilling project and product requirements.
        - Quality focuses on meeting acceptance criteria for deliverables.
        - Project quality entails ensuring project processes are appropriate and as effective as possible.

  9. Navigate complexity
    - Complexity
      + Continually evaluate and natigate project complexity so that approachese and plans enable the project team to successfully navigate the project life cycle.
        - Complexity can emerge at any point during the project.
        - Complexity can be introduced by events or conditions that affect value, scope, communications, stakeholders, risk, and technological innovation.
        - Project teams can stay vigilant in identifying elements of complexity and use a variety of methods to reduce the amount or impact of complexity.

  10. Optimize risk responses
    - Risk
      + Constantly evaluate exposure to risk, both opportunities and threats, to maximize positive impacts and minimize negative impacts to the project ans its outcomes.
        - Individual and overall risks can impact projects.
        - Risks can be positive (opportunities) or negative (threats).
        - Risks are addressed continually throughout the project.
        - An organization's risk attitude, appetite, and threshold influence how risk is addressed.
        - Risk responses should be approriate for the significance of the risk, cost effective, realistic within the project context, agreed to by relevant stakeholders, and owned by a responsble person.

  11. Embrace adaptability and resiliency
    - Adaptability and resiliency
      + Build adaptability and resiliency into the organization's and project team's approaches to help the project accommodate change, recover from setbacks, and advance the work of the project.
        - Adaptability is the ability to respond to changing conditions.
        - Resiliency is the ability to absorb impacts and to recover quickly from a setback or failure.
        - Build adaptability and resiliency into the organization's and project team's approaches.

  12. Enable change to achieve the envisioned future state
    - Change
      + Prepare those impacted for the adoption and sustainment of new and different behaviors and processes required for the transition from the current state to the intended future state created by the project outcomes.
        - A structured approach to change helps individuals, groups, and the organization transition from the current state to a future desired state.
        - Change can originate from internal influences or external sources.
        - Enabling change can be challenging as not all stakeholders embrace change.
        - Attempting too much change in a short time can lead to change fatigue and/or resistance.
        - Stakeholder engagement and motivational approaches assist in change adoption.

Principles and perfomance domain:
  - Domains are a group of related activities that are critical for the effective delivery of project outcomes
  - They operate as an integrated system, with each domain being interdependent of the other domains to enable successful delivery of the project and tis intended outcomes.
  - The specific activities undertaken within each of the performance domains are determined by the context fo the organization, the project, deliverables, the project team, stakeholders, and other factors.

  1. Stakeholder performance domain
    - Addresses activities and functions associcated with stakeholders
      + Effective stakeholder interaction contributes to successful project outcomes.
      + Stakeholder engagemnet includes implementing strategies and actions to promote productive involvemnet of stakeholders in rpoject decision making and implementation.

  2. Team performance domain
    - Deals with activities and functions associated with the people who are responsbile for creating project deliverables that realize business outcomes.
      + The project team is a set of individuals performing tht work of the project to achieve its objectives.
      + An environment can be established to support the team in evolving into a high performance team.
      + This includes fostering team development, encouraging leadership behaviors from all project team members and sharing ownership for the outcome.

  3. Development Approach and Life Cycle performance domain
    - Deals with activities and functions associated with the development approach, cadence, and life cycle phases of the project.
      + The project deliverables determine the most appropriate development approach such as a predictive, adaptive, or hybrid approach.
      + The deliverables and the development approach influence the number and cadence fro project deliverables.
      + The development approach and delivery cadence influence the project life cycle and its phases.

  4. Planning perfomance domain
    - Deals with activities and functions associated with the initial, ongoing, and evolving organization and coordination necessary for delivering project deliverables and outcomes.
      + Planning organizes, elaborates, and coordinates work throughout the project.
      + Planning takes places up front and/or throughout the project.
      + The amount, timing, and frequency varies depending on the product, development approach, environment, and stakeholders.

  5. Project Work perfomance domain
    - Deals with activities and functions associated with establishing project processes, managing physical resources, and fostering a learning environment.
      + Project work is associated with establishing the processes and performing the work to enable the project team to deliver the expected values and outcomes.
      + Project work includes communication, engagement, managing physical resources, procurements, and other work to keep project operations running smoothly

  6. Project Delivery performance domain
    - Deals with activities and functions associated with delivering the scope and quality that the project was undertaken to achieve.
      + Proejct delivery focuses on meeting requirements, scope, and quality expectations to deliver the expected outputs taht will drive intended outcomes.
      + Projects may use a delivery approach that supports releasing deliverables throughout the project lifecycle, at specific points, or at the end of the project.
      + Business value often continues to be captured long after the project has ended.

  7. Measurement performance domain
    - Deals with activities and functions associated with assessing project performance and taking approriate actions to maintain acceptable performance.
      + Measurement involves assessing project performance and implementing approriate responses to maintain optimal performance.
      + This domain evaluates the degree to which the project deliveries and perfomance are meeting the intented outcomes.
      + Having timely and accurate information about delivery and performance allows the team to learn and determine the approriate action to take to address current or expected variances from the desired performance.

  8. Uncertainty performnace domain
    - Deals with activities and functions associated with risk and uncertainty.
      + Projects exist in environments with varying degrees of uncertainty, and uncertainty presents threats and opportunities that project teams explore and assess and then decide how to handle.
      + Uncertainty, in the broadest sense, is a state of now knowing or unpredictability.
      + There are many nuances to uncertainty, such as:
        - risk associated with not knowing future events.
        - ambiguity associated with not being aware of current or future conditions.
        - complexity associated with dynamic systems with unpredictable outcomes, and many others.

Change Models
Managing Chage in Organizations: A Practice Guide [3] is an iterative model that is founded on common elements across a range of change management models.
  - Formular change.
  - Plan change.
  - Implement change.
  - Manage transition.
  - Sustain change.

ADKAR Model - focuses on five sequential steps that individuals endure when adapting to change:
  - Step 1: Awareness: Identify why the change
  - Step 2: Desire: Desire to support the change
  - Step 3: Knowledge: How to change
  - Step 4: Ability: Hands-on practice of change
  - Step 5: Reinforcement: Rewards

The 8-step Process for Leading Change
Top-down approach where the change originates at the top levels of the organization, and then is promoted down through the organization's. The eight steps are:
	- Step 1: Create urgency
	- Step 2: Form a powerful coalition
	- Step 3: Create a vision for changed
	- Step 4: Communicate the vison.
	- Step 5: Remove obstacles.
	- Step 6: Create short-term wins
	- Step 7: Build on the change
	- Step 8: Achor the changes in corporate culture.

Virginia Satir Change Models
A model of how people experience and cope with change.
Help project team members understand what they are feeling and enable them to move through change more efficiently
	- Late status quo (the current state)
	- The foreign element (the change come into place)
	- Chaos
	- The transforming idea
	- Practice and integration
	- New status quo (the desired state)

Transition Model William Bridges
Transition Model delivers and understanding of what happens to individuals psychologically when an organizational change takes place.
The model identifies three stages of transition associated with change
	- Ending, losing, and letting go
	- The neutral zone
	- The new beginning

---------------------
Drexler/Sibbet Team Performance Model
Allan Drelex and David Sibbet developed a team performance model with 7 steps.
Step 1 through 4 describe the stages in creating a project team, and step 5 through 7 cover project team sustainability and performacne:
	- Step 1: Orientation: Why
	- Step 2: Trust building: Who
	- Step 3: Goal clarificatioin: What
	- Step 4: Commitment: How, define the plan
	- Step 5: Implementation: Start working
	- Step 6: High performance: Reach a high level
	- Step 7: Renewal: Working through changes

Predictive Project Management

Common Inputs:
EEF (regulations): 
  - internal or external, effect positive or negative to the outcome of the project, rules or laws you need to follows in the country, your place, or the company. It's not a part of the project itself.
  - Ex:
    +Internal EEF: Organizational culture, Infrastruture, Resource Availability, Employee Capacity, Software,...
    + Internal EEF: Political Climate, Government or Industry Standards, Commercial Databases, Legal Restrictions, Financial Consideration,...

OPA (templates): 
  - Organizations have assets such as information, policies, procedures, documents, or knowledge bases. OPA will help the org to achieve to their objectives.
  - They are kept in some central repository, can be used whenever required.
  - OPA affect a several aspects of the project.
  - Project team members update and add to the OPA throughout the project.
  - Ex:
    + Project templates
    + Software tools
    + Historical information
    + Project closure guideline
    + Risk control procedures
    + Change control procedures
    + Issue and defect managenemt procedures

Project document
  - Any documents that are related to the project, 
  _ They are additional documents that are created and used throughout the 49 processes that are not part of project management plan.
  - They include but are not limited to
  - Ex:
    + Risk register
    + Issues logs
    + Requirement documentations
    + ...

Project managemnet plan
  - Defines how the project is execute, monitored and controlled, and closed
  - 18 components, 14 plans and 4 baselines
  - "include but are not limited to"

-----------
Common tools

Expert Judgement
  - One of the most common tools in the planning process
  - Includes hiring an expert or subject matter expert (SME) to help yolu to plan a process or conduct a process
  - People with specialized knowledge or training in a particular process, industry, or technoloty

Data Gathering => Data Analysis => Data Reprensentation => Decision Making
  - Data Gather
    + Gather data about a particular process that you're working on
    + On certain processes, you will need to gather additional data before coming up with an output for that process
    + Methods:
      - Brainstorming
      - Interviews
      - Focus groups
      - Checklist
      - Questionnaires and surveys

  - Data Analysis
    + TO analyze the data that has been gathered
    + Methods:
      - Alternative analysis: involves looking at different options or ways to accomplish something
      - Root cause analysis (RCA): is used to identify the main underlining reason for particular event
      - Variance analysis: is used quite often to find the exact differences between different things
      - Trend analysis: involes looking at data over a period of time to see if a particular trand is forming

  - Data Representation
    + Illustrate different ways taht a data could be shown to stakeholders
    + Methods generally include the use of charts matrixes, and different types of diagrams
    + Examples:
      - Flowcharts: tell you how to follow a particular process (they're like box, do it, then do it...)
      - Fishbone diagrams (or Ishikawa diagram): usually used in the quality section
      - Histograms (bar charts): can represent data

  - Decision making
    + Have to make a decision on what to do with that data
    + Methods:
      - Voting: used by group to determine whether to proceed, change, or reject something. Voting maybe:
       + Majority wins
       + Unanimity: everyon agrees 
       + Plurility: majority is not obtained but that decision is chosen.
      - Multicriteria decision analysis: make a table (matrix) that lists different types of criteria, and then evaluate an idea based on those criteria.
      - Autocratic decision making: One person makes a decision for entire team

Interpersonal and Team Skills
  - All project managers need to have good interpersonal and team skills in order to manage the different stakeholders that will be on the project.
  - Most important tool in real-life project management
  - Methods:
    + Active listening: understanding, acknowledging, and clarifying what others are saying to you.
    + Conflict management: Anytime you bring a team together, bound to have conflicts on that team.
    + Facilitation: is the art of managing a group. This can include bringing the group together, generating ideas, solving problems, and dissipating the team.
    + Meeting management: generally includes having an agenda, inviting the right stakeholders, setting a time limit, ang following up with meeting minutes and action items.

Meeting
  - Meetings can be done face-to-face or virtually.
  - Have an agenda and distribute it to all attendees before the meeting.
  - Meetings must be timed, including having set start and finish times for topics and the entire meeting.
  - Make sure that the meeting always stays on topic and does not go off topic.
  - Ensure that all attendees have input to the topics.
  - Distribute detailed meeting minutes once the meeting is complete

------------
Common Outputs

Change Request
  - Proposal to change a document, deliverable, or baseline
  - Can include a request to add or remove work from the scope, finish the project faster, or complete the project more cheaply
  - Implements:
    + Corrective action: is something that's taken to ensure that the project gets back on track.
    + Preventive action: is something you put in place to ensure the project stays on track.
    + Defect repair: is done to fix a broken component on a project, such as if network switch memory fails on a network upgrade project.

Work Performance Data => Work Performance Information => Work Performance Report

Work Performnace Data
  - is simply raw data
  - is the status of the work that was done but does not have any analysis applied to it
  - is not useful by itself
  - Usually outputs of executing processes

Work Performance Information
  - Information of the work that was performed compared to the plan.
  - It gives you actual status about the deliverables.
  - Is usually the output of most monitoring and controlling processes.

Work Performance Report
  - Overall status report of the actual project
  - It takes all the work performance information and puts it together into one comprehensive document.
  - You take the work performance data and compare it against the plant to come up with the work performance information. Then you take all the work performance information and create the work performance reports. In short, data feeds info and all the info creates reports.

Updates (Project Management Plan, Project documens, EEF, OPA)
  - Updates is a catchall term.
  - Updates can include project documents, the project management plan, OPA and EEF updates.
  - Expect to see this output many times throughout the book.

------------
Initiating a Project

Project charter = Authorization of a project -> you need to know all stakeholders that are involved on your project.

Develop Project Charter
  - The process of developing a document to formally authorize a project or a phase
  - Outlines the project objective
  - Defines the authority of the project manager
  - Provides the project manager with the authority to put the resources togehter to project activities
  - The approved project charter formally initiates the project.

Business Document: explains why we need this project? What are the benefit of the project?
Agreement (~contract): get a contract with someone else 

Ouput:
  - Project charter:
    + Formally authorizes the existence of the project and it assigns the PM and their authority level
    + Signed by the organization senior management
    + High level requirements & risks
    + Preliminary Project Budget and Schedule
    + Project Purpose or justification
 - Assumption Log:
    + A list of things that you perceive to be true (assumptions) and things that might constrain the project.
