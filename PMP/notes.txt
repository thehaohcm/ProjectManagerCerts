The Traditional PM Mindset
- Identification and analysis of stackholders is something that is done throughout the project not jsut at the beginning.
- Always follow a plan and never allow changes to the plan without an aproved change request.
- Any stakeholder that wants to change any component of the project management plan will need to submit a change request.
- All change requests will need to be reviewed and assessed.
- Never take actions without first creating a plan.
- Consult with the project team before making decisions, as they will have a more pratical approach.
- Your final decision should always benefit the objectives of the project. For example, if there are conflicting methods on how to complete a particular task, then choose the method that would deliver the most value to the project outcome.
- Try to use tools that are inclusive such as a whiteboard with a marker versus complex software.
- All scope changes should be assessed on how it will impact all other parts of the project including schedule, cost, quality, resources, communications, risk, procurement, and stakeholder management.
- When conducting estimating uses a bottom-up approach and not a top-down. This will lead to more correct estimates but will require more work.
- Your man job is to be an integrator of the many different components within a project. Do not concentrate your time and efforts on one particular thing while ignoring others.
- Update the lesson learned register throughout the entire project. This way it can be transferred to future projects in the organization.
- When closing the project ensure all bills are paid off and resources are released.
- Projects that are terminated early still needs to be close formally through the close project or phase process.
- The best people to break down work is the project team.
- The best people to determine when a particular activity may happen is also the project team.
- Quality requirements should be defined early in the project and be checked often ensure they are getting done.
- The customers are the best people to check a deliverable for scope conference and quality requirements being met as they are the ones that will actually use the product.
- Before resolving a conflict between team members be sure to understand the source of the conflict.
- Conflicts between team member should always be resolved for the benefits of the project objectives not to satify one member over another.
- Before communications are sent out to stakeholders, ensure to analyze their needs and determine what they're looking for, how often, what method they would like it to be delivered, and who will deliver it to them.
- Utilize the skills of emotional intelligence to analyze your own feelings and those around you to respond to stakeholders needs and requirements. Emotional intelligence allows you to solve problems quicker and more effectively.
- Identify as much risk as possible as early as possible on the project. All identified risks should be documented int he risk register along with their corresponding risk responses.
- A negative risk is known as a threat while positive risk is known as an opportunity. Ensure to identify and document responses to both.
- When selecting a contract to use on a project with potential sellers, always use a contract that is mutually beneficial to both the seller and the buyer to the overall benefits of the project objectives.
- Engage stakeholder often and regularly. Use things such as meetings, one-on-one conversations, phone calls, and presentations to engage them.
- When engaging your stakeholders ensure they understand the communications that they are receiving. Tailor your communications to individual stakeholder needs.

The Agile PM Mindset:
- Be a servant leader to the team at all times. This includes empowering them and removing any impediments. Give them the tools they need to succeed while staying out of their way.
- Engage the product owner to document the features and to prioritize them in the product backlog.
- Only the product owner can prioritize the features in the product backlog. If the product owner refuses to do so because they feel all of them are valuable, then you must train them on the benefits of doing so. DO NOT prioritize the features yourself, this is the job of the product owner.
- Use a co-location.
- Face-to-face communications with a white board and markers are the best form of communications.
- Provide agile teams with lots wall space so they can write on them and use sticky notes.
- Information should always be radiated through the use of large charts and graphs, such as the use of a burnup or burned down chart.
- Any problem that occurs on a project should be resolved by the project team. Always let the project team choose a solution while coaching and supporting their solutions.
- Provide a safe environment for disagreements. Do not punish anyone for having a difference of opinion. Understand that conflicts is a positive step and an opportunity to learn.
- Try to limit the work in progress through thu use of the Kanban. Kanban boards should be displayed either on a large whiteboard or less desirable large monitor.
- Consistently communicate and re-communicate the project vision to the team.
- Understand the needs of your team members and find out what may motivate them.
- Make sure people understand what failure and success will look like on the project.
- Be a central figure to the team, not a dictator.
- Have good ethical values.
- Review the methods work was completed by doing a retrospective.
- Utilize feedback loops. Feedback loops occurs when you've completed the task and then take what you've learned form that and input the lesson learned into your next task

Formulars in PMP exam:
- BAC (Budget At Completion): Original budget of the project.
- AC (Actual Cost): Amount of money you already spent on the project.

- PV (Planned Value): Amount of money worth of work we that should have been done on the project
  - PV = Planned % Completed x BAC
- EV (Earned Value): Amount of money worth of work you actually did on the project.
  - EV = Actual % Completed x BAC
- CV (Cost Variance) 
  - CV = EV - AC
- SV (Schedule Variance)
  - SV = EV - PV
- CPI (Cost Performance Index)
  - CPI = EV / AC
- SPI (Schedule Performance Index)
  - SPI = EV / PV
- EAC (Estimate At Completion)
  - EAC = BAC / CPI
- ETC (Estimate To Completion)
  - ETC = EAC - AC
- VAC (Variance At Completion)
  - VAC = BAC - EAC
- TCPI (To-Complete Performance Index) 
  - TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC) 

Theories & models in PMP exam:

Tuckman's Five Stage:
1. Forming
2. Storming
3. Norming
4. Performing
5. Adjourning

Retrospective stages:
1. Set stage
2. Gather data
3. Generate Insights
4. Decide what to do
5. Close Retrospective

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (represent the 5 levels of basic human needs):
1. Physiological
2. Safety
3. Social
4. Esteem
5. Self-actualization

ERG Theory
similar to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, but it focuses on existence, relatedness, and growth needs.
1. existence (including the needs of food, drink, shelter, and saftety)
2. relatedness needs (include the need to feel connected to other individuals or a group. Relatedness needs are fulfilled by establishing and maintaining relationships.)
3. growth needs (are fulfilled by personal achievement and self-actualization.

McGregor's Theory X & Theory Y
Theory X (bad): when the management believe that: 
- The average worker, who has an inherent dislike of work and will avoid it if possible. 
- They must be controlled before they will work hard enough.
- They prefer to be directed and dislike responsibility.
- They are not ambitious, and desires security above everything else.
- They need micro-manager
- Management don't trust employee
- Theory X manager can be a difficult person to work with.

Theory Y (good): when the management believe that:
- The average worker wants to be active and finds the physical and mental effort on the job to be satifying.
- The greatest results come from willing participation, which will tend to produce self-dicrection toward goals without coercion or control.
- The avaerage worker seeks the opportunity for personal improvement and self-respsect.
- Imagination, creativity, and ingenutiy can be used to solved work problems by a large number of employees

Ouchi Theory Z: 
- Enhance motivation
- Increase employee loyalty
- Encourage steady employement
- Management looks at the wellbeing of the employees
- Provides work for them at work and outside work


Herzberg's Motivation-Hygiene Theory:
Hygiene Factors (don't motivate a worker to perform, but if they are not implemented, can lead to employee dissatisfication) :
- Policies
- Administration
- Working conditions
- Salary
- Satus
- Supervision
- Security

Motivation Factors (lead to higher individual performance):
- Achievement
- Recognition
- Growth
- Advancement
- Interest in the job
- Job challenge

McClelland's Theory of Needs:
People are motivated by power, achievement, or affilitation, and that how you manage a person is different based on what motivates taht individual.
There are 3 kinds of People needs:
- Power: These people like to organize, motivate, and lead others. Rewards should be focused on giving them more responsibility.
- Achievement: These people are result oriented. They like to reach a goal and be recognized for it. They like challenges that are reasonable.
- Affiliation: These people seek acceptance and belonging. They like being part of a team.

Vroom's Expectancy Theory
The theory supports the concept of the reward being tied to performance, and ensuring that the reward is what the employee wants. It emphasizes the links between behavior, rewards, and the organizationâ€™s goals.

Expectanry Theory:
People behave based on what they expect as a result of their behavior.

Forms of Power:
- Reward Power: Ability to give rewards.
- Expert Power: SME
- Legitimate (formal power)
- Referent: Respsect/Personality of the Manager
- Punishment: Punish associates when they fail (least desirable)

Drelex/Sibbet Team Performance Model:
Step 1 to step 4 describe the stages in creating a projec team
Step 5 through 7 cover project team sustainability and performance
- Step 1: Orientation: Why
- Step 2: Trust building: Who
- Step 3: Goal clarification: What
- Step 4: Commitment: How, define the plan
- Step 5: Implementation: Starts working
- Step 6: High performance: Reach a high level
- Step 7: Renewal: Working through changes

- Parento diagram: Histogram
- Scatter diagram: Show trends
- Control chart: Rule of seven
