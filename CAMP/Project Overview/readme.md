An adaptive lifecycle project => Agile methology => Servant leadership type
Agile Manifesto: Focus on the delivery of functionality to achieve business value
Agile teams are cross-functional and rely on the knowledge of the group to get the work done

The types of PMOs are supportive, controlling, and directive. Indirective is a made-up PMO. 
A controlling PMO offers support and requires compliance through various means
A controlling project management office supports the project through frameworks and methodologies.

Trend analysis should be used when needing to examine the past results of the project to see if its performance is improving or deteriorating. A trend analysis uses mathematical models to forecast future outcomes based on historical results. 

The status report should be used when needing to know where the project stands regarding the performance measurement baseline. 

The forecasting report should be used when needing to review the project's future status and performance. 

Variance analysis should be used when needing to compare the project's actual results to its baselines.

The Complete Performance Index (TCPI) is a measure of the cost performance that must be achieved with the remaining resources to meet a specified management goal. In other words, it is the efficiency needed to finish the project on budget; it is the ratio between budgeted cost of work remaining and money remaining. TCPI is used in Control Costs (7.4) and the formulas are as follows:

Under Budget Formula

(BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC)

> 1 harder to complete; < 1 easier to complete

Over Budget Formula

(BAC - EV) / (EAC - AC)

> 1 harder to complete; < 1 easier to complete

Estimate At Completion (EAC) is the estimated total amount of money needed to be put into the project based on the information available today.

Budget At completion (BAC) is the sum of all budgets established for the work to be performed.

Schedule Performance Index (SPI) is the ratio between Earned Value (EV) and Planned Value (PV), to reflect whether the project work is ahead of, on, or behind schedule in relative terms.

Return on Investment (ROI) is a measure of the amount of financial return compared to the cost. ROI is often part of the decision-making process to proceed with a project. It is important to understand that ROI may be different at different times during the lifecycle of a project. However, measuring ROI throughout the project enables the team to evaluate if they should continue organizational resource investments.
