The types of PMOs are supportive, controlling, and directive. Indirective is a made-up PMO. 
A controlling PMO offers support and requires compliance through various means
A controlling project management office supports the project through frameworks and methodologies.

A Project Management Office (PMO) is an organizational structure that standardizes the project-related governance processes and facilitates the sharing of resources, methodologies, tools, and techniques. There are several types of PMOs in organizations. Each type varies in the amount of control and influence it has on projects within the organization.

 + Supportive: Supportive PMOs provide a consultative role to projects by supplying templates, best practices, training, access to information, and lessons learned from other projects. The degree of control provided by this PMO is low.
 + Controlling: Controlling PMOs provide support and require compliance through various means. The degree of control provided by this PMO is moderate. Compliance may involve adoptions of project management frameworks or methodologies; use of specific templates, forms, and tools; and conformance to governance frameworks.
 + Directive: Directive PMOs take control of the projects by directly managing the projects. Project managers are assigned by and report to the PMO. The degree of control provided by this PMO is high.

Trend analysis should be used when needing to examine the past results of the project to see if its performance is improving or deteriorating. A trend analysis uses mathematical models to forecast future outcomes based on historical results. 

The status report should be used when needing to know where the project stands regarding the performance measurement baseline. 

The forecasting report should be used when needing to review the project's future status and performance. 

Variance analysis should be used when needing to compare the project's actual results to its baselines.

To Complete Performance Index (TCP) is a measure of the cost performance that must be achieved with the remaining resources to meet a specified management goal expressed as the ratio of the cost to finish the outstanding work to the budget available.
To calculate the efficiency that must be maintained to complete on plan, use the following formula:

TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC)

+ TCPI> 1.0 is harder to complete
+ TCPI = 1.0 is same to complete
+ TCPI< 1.0 is easier to complete

To calculate the efficiency that must be maintained to complete the current EAC, use the following formula:

TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (EAC - AC)

+ TCPI> 1.0 is harder to complete
+ TCPI = 1.0 is same to complete
+ TCPI < 1.0 is easier to complete


-----
Return on Investment (ROI) is a measure of the amount of financial return compared to the cost. ROI is often part of the decision-making process to proceed with a project. It is important to understand that ROI may be different at different times during the lifecycle of a project. However, measuring ROI throughout the project enables the team to evaluate if they should continue organizational resource investments.

-----
There are five project management process groups: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring & Controlling, and Closing. The process groups interact within each phase of a project life cycle. It is possible that all these processes could occur within a single phase. The number of iterations and interactions between processes varies based on the needs of the project.

-----
This method of finding the critical path requires you to compute a quantity known as the task slack time. Slack time (also called float) is the amount of delay, expressed in units of time, that could be tolerated in the starting time or completion time of a task without causing a delay in the completion of the project.

To figure the float, one can use either the start formula or the finish formula:
Start Formula: Float = LS - ES
Finish Formula: Float = LF - EF

-----
The range on a control chart is usually calculated based on -3 or +3 sigma. The project manager and stakeholders are usually responsible for determining the project's acceptable range of measurements between the upper and lower control limits on the control chart.

----
Sequence activities include the process of identifying and documenting relationships concerning project activities. A primary benefit of sequence activities is that it defines the logical sequence of work. This is vital to obtain the greatest efficiency given all project constraints.

----
Dividing large projects into phases occurs during the initiating phase of the project management process. Large complex projects should be divided into separate phases. In such projects, the initiating processes are carried out during subsequent phases to validate the decisions made during the original Develop Project Charter and Identify Stakeholders processes. Performing the initiating processes at the start of each phase helps to keep the project focused on the business needs that the project was undertaken to address.

Other actions that fall into the initiating phase include selecting the project manager; determining the company culture and existing systems; collecting processes, procedures, and historical information; understanding the business case; uncovering the initial requirements, assumptions, and risks; assessing the project and product feasibility within the given constraints; creating measurable objectives; developing the project charter; identifying stakeholders; and developing a stakeholder management strategy.

-----
The statement best describes an Actual Cost (AC). Actual costs is the realized cost incurred for the work on the activity during a particular time period. 

Estimate To Complete (ETC) is the current forecasted cost to finish the project. Budget At Completion (BAC) is the amount that was originally budgeted for the total project effort. Earned Value (EV) is the estimated value of work that has been accomplished.

A product ownerâ€™s job is to guide the direction of the product. Product owners categorize and rank the work based on business value. The project team will work with product owners by providing feedback and setting the direction on the following requirements or functionality.

Cross-functional teams consist of members with all the skills necessary to produce a working product. The cross-functional development teams consist of professionals who deliver a potentially releasable product on a regular cadence. These types of teams are essential because of their ability to deliver completed work in the shortest time, with higher quality, and without external dependencies.

Team facilitators are project managers, scrum masters, project team leads, team coaches, or facilitators. Team facilitators are also servant leaders by removing impediments and fostering team growth.

In sum, the three agile team roles are cross-functional team members, product owners, and team facilitators. 

-----
The quality assurance department, or another group outside of the project, is responsible for performing the quality assurance assessment on a project. The quality assurance team seeks to make sure the project team is following the planned procedures and processes and looks for ways to improve the work that is being done.

-----
The assumption and constraint analysis makes certain that the assumptions and constraints are consistently integrated into the project plans and documents. A constraint is identified as a limiting factor that influences the execution of a portfolio, program, project, or process. An assumption is a factor that is true, real, or certain without any type of evidence or demonstration. 

-----
Governance is the framework within which authority is exercised in organizations. This framework includes rules, policies, procedures, norms, relationships, systems, and processes. Governance influences how objectives of the organization are set and achieved, risk is monitored and assessed, and performance is optimized. A governance framework should be tailored to the organizational culture, types of projects, and the needs of the organization to be effective.

-----
activities for administrative closure:
 + Ensuring all documents and deliverables are current and that all issues have been resolved
 + Confirm delivery and formal acceptance of deliverables by the customer
 + Verify that all costs are charged to the project
 + Close the project accounts
 + Reassign personnel
 + Coordinate action with excess project material
 + Reallocate the facilities, equipment, and other resources of the project
 + Elaborate the final project reports as required by organizational policies

----
Analogous estimating is a technique for estimating the duration or cost of an activity or a project using historical data from a similar activity or project. It is generally less costly and less time-consuming than other forms of estimating; however, it is also the least accurate method. Analogous estimating uses professional judgment and chronological information to forecast the future.

There are five general techniques for resolving conflict. Each technique has its unique place and use:
 + Collaborate/problem solve: Incorporating multiple viewpoints and insights from differing perspectives; requires a cooperative attitude and open dialogue. This approach can result in a win-win situation.
 + Withdraw/avoid: Retreating from an actual or potential conflict situation; postponing the issue to be better prepared or to be resolved by others.
 + Smooth/accommodate: Highlighting areas of agreement rather than areas of difference; conceding one's position to the needs of others to maintain harmony.
 + Compromise/reconcile: Searching for solutions that bring some degree of satisfaction to all parties to temporarily or partially resolve the conflict. This is generally a lose-lose situation.
 + Force/direct: Pushing one's viewpoint at the expense of others; offering only win-lose solutions, usually enforced through a power position. This is often a win-lose situation.

While similar to smooth/accommodate, the conflict management technique being used in this scenario is collaborate/problem solve, which is used to get to the root of an issue so that it will lead to consensus and commitment.

Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract provides for an indefinite quantity of goods or services at a stated lower and upper limit. IDIQ occurs within a fixed time period and is best applied to architectural, engineering, or IT engagements. 

-----
Work performance reports are physical or electronic representations of work performance information that is compiled into project documents. The performance of work performance reports is to generate decision making or raise issues, actions, or awareness. A few examples of work performance reports include status reports, memos, justifications, information notes, electronic dashboards, recommendations, and updates. 

-----
The critical path refers to the sequence or order of schedule activities that will make up the entire duration of a project. It represents the longest path through the entirety of the project, and typically, this path consists of every single activity that must be concluded from the kickoff to the ultimate conclusion of the project. Being the longest path, it is also the shortest possible duration of the project. The critical path will help the project manager to determine the length of time the project will take and where their attention would be best focused.

-----
Identify Stakeholders is the process of identifying project stakeholders regularly and analyzing and documenting relevant information regarding their interest, involvement, interdependencies, influence, and potential impact on project success. This process enables the project team to identify an appropriate focus to engage stakeholders. Identify Stakeholders is a process that will be performed throughout the project as necessary. 

Manage Stakeholder Engagement is a process of communicating and working with stakeholders to meet their needs/expectations, address issues as they occur, and foster appropriate stakeholder engagement and project activities throughout the project lifecycle.

Monitor Stakeholder Engagement is the process of monitoring project stakeholder relationships and tailoring strategies for engaging stakeholders through modification of engagement strategies and plans.

Plan Stakeholder Engagement is the process of developing approaches to involve project stakeholders based on their needs, expectations, interest, and potential impact on the project.

-----
The business case justifies the project and is used to determine whether the expected outcomes justify the required investment. The available budget is not used to support the justification for the project.

The business case is based on one or more of the following: market demand, organizational need, customer request, technology advancement, legal requirements, ecological impacts, or social need.
