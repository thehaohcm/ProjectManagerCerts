The types of PMOs are supportive, controlling, and directive. Indirective is a made-up PMO. 
A controlling PMO offers support and requires compliance through various means
A controlling project management office supports the project through frameworks and methodologies.

A Project Management Office (PMO) is an organizational structure that standardizes the project-related governance processes and facilitates the sharing of resources, methodologies, tools, and techniques. There are several types of PMOs in organizations. Each type varies in the amount of control and influence it has on projects within the organization.

 + Supportive: Supportive PMOs provide a consultative role to projects by supplying templates, best practices, training, access to information, and lessons learned from other projects. The degree of control provided by this PMO is low.
 + Controlling: Controlling PMOs provide support and require compliance through various means. The degree of control provided by this PMO is moderate. Compliance may involve adoptions of project management frameworks or methodologies; use of specific templates, forms, and tools; and conformance to governance frameworks.
 + Directive: Directive PMOs take control of the projects by directly managing the projects. Project managers are assigned by and report to the PMO. The degree of control provided by this PMO is high.

Trend analysis should be used when needing to examine the past results of the project to see if its performance is improving or deteriorating. A trend analysis uses mathematical models to forecast future outcomes based on historical results. 

The status report should be used when needing to know where the project stands regarding the performance measurement baseline. 

The forecasting report should be used when needing to review the project's future status and performance. 

Variance analysis should be used when needing to compare the project's actual results to its baselines.

To Complete Performance Index (TCP) is a measure of the cost performance that must be achieved with the remaining resources to meet a specified management goal expressed as the ratio of the cost to finish the outstanding work to the budget available.
To calculate the efficiency that must be maintained to complete on plan, use the following formula:

TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC)

+ TCPI> 1.0 is harder to complete
+ TCPI = 1.0 is same to complete
+ TCPI< 1.0 is easier to complete

To calculate the efficiency that must be maintained to complete the current EAC, use the following formula:

TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (EAC - AC)

+ TCPI> 1.0 is harder to complete
+ TCPI = 1.0 is same to complete
+ TCPI < 1.0 is easier to complete


-----
Return on Investment (ROI) is a measure of the amount of financial return compared to the cost. ROI is often part of the decision-making process to proceed with a project. It is important to understand that ROI may be different at different times during the lifecycle of a project. However, measuring ROI throughout the project enables the team to evaluate if they should continue organizational resource investments.

-----
There are five project management process groups: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring & Controlling, and Closing. The process groups interact within each phase of a project life cycle. It is possible that all these processes could occur within a single phase. The number of iterations and interactions between processes varies based on the needs of the project.

-----
This method of finding the critical path requires you to compute a quantity known as the task slack time. Slack time (also called float) is the amount of delay, expressed in units of time, that could be tolerated in the starting time or completion time of a task without causing a delay in the completion of the project.

To figure the float, one can use either the start formula or the finish formula:
Start Formula: Float = LS - ES
Finish Formula: Float = LF - EF

-----
The range on a control chart is usually calculated based on -3 or +3 sigma. The project manager and stakeholders are usually responsible for determining the project's acceptable range of measurements between the upper and lower control limits on the control chart.

----
Sequence activities include the process of identifying and documenting relationships concerning project activities. A primary benefit of sequence activities is that it defines the logical sequence of work. This is vital to obtain the greatest efficiency given all project constraints.

----
Dividing large projects into phases occurs during the initiating phase of the project management process. Large complex projects should be divided into separate phases. In such projects, the initiating processes are carried out during subsequent phases to validate the decisions made during the original Develop Project Charter and Identify Stakeholders processes. Performing the initiating processes at the start of each phase helps to keep the project focused on the business needs that the project was undertaken to address.

Other actions that fall into the initiating phase include selecting the project manager; determining the company culture and existing systems; collecting processes, procedures, and historical information; understanding the business case; uncovering the initial requirements, assumptions, and risks; assessing the project and product feasibility within the given constraints; creating measurable objectives; developing the project charter; identifying stakeholders; and developing a stakeholder management strategy.

-----
The statement best describes an Actual Cost (AC). Actual costs is the realized cost incurred for the work on the activity during a particular time period. 

Estimate To Complete (ETC) is the current forecasted cost to finish the project. Budget At Completion (BAC) is the amount that was originally budgeted for the total project effort. Earned Value (EV) is the estimated value of work that has been accomplished.

-----
A product owner’s job is to guide the direction of the product. Product owners categorize and rank the work based on business value. The project team will work with product owners by providing feedback and setting the direction on the following requirements or functionality.

Cross-functional teams consist of members with all the skills necessary to produce a working product. The cross-functional development teams consist of professionals who deliver a potentially releasable product on a regular cadence. These types of teams are essential because of their ability to deliver completed work in the shortest time, with higher quality, and without external dependencies.

Team facilitators are project managers, scrum masters, project team leads, team coaches, or facilitators. Team facilitators are also servant leaders by removing impediments and fostering team growth.

In sum, the three agile team roles are cross-functional team members, product owners, and team facilitators. 

-----
The quality assurance department, or another group outside of the project, is responsible for performing the quality assurance assessment on a project. The quality assurance team seeks to make sure the project team is following the planned procedures and processes and looks for ways to improve the work that is being done.

-----
The assumption and constraint analysis makes certain that the assumptions and constraints are consistently integrated into the project plans and documents. A constraint is identified as a limiting factor that influences the execution of a portfolio, program, project, or process. An assumption is a factor that is true, real, or certain without any type of evidence or demonstration. 

-----
Governance is the framework within which authority is exercised in organizations. This framework includes rules, policies, procedures, norms, relationships, systems, and processes. Governance influences how objectives of the organization are set and achieved, risk is monitored and assessed, and performance is optimized. A governance framework should be tailored to the organizational culture, types of projects, and the needs of the organization to be effective.

-----
activities for administrative closure:
 + Ensuring all documents and deliverables are current and that all issues have been resolved
 + Confirm delivery and formal acceptance of deliverables by the customer
 + Verify that all costs are charged to the project
 + Close the project accounts
 + Reassign personnel
 + Coordinate action with excess project material
 + Reallocate the facilities, equipment, and other resources of the project
 + Elaborate the final project reports as required by organizational policies

----
Analogous estimating is a technique for estimating the duration or cost of an activity or a project using historical data from a similar activity or project. It is generally less costly and less time-consuming than other forms of estimating; however, it is also the least accurate method. Analogous estimating uses professional judgment and chronological information to forecast the future.

----
There are five general techniques for resolving conflict. Each technique has its unique place and use:
 + Collaborate/problem solve: Incorporating multiple viewpoints and insights from differing perspectives; requires a cooperative attitude and open dialogue. This approach can result in a win-win situation.
 + Withdraw/avoid: Retreating from an actual or potential conflict situation; postponing the issue to be better prepared or to be resolved by others.
 + Smooth/accommodate: Highlighting areas of agreement rather than areas of difference; conceding one's position to the needs of others to maintain harmony.
 + Compromise/reconcile: Searching for solutions that bring some degree of satisfaction to all parties to temporarily or partially resolve the conflict. This is generally a lose-lose situation.
 + Force/direct: Pushing one's viewpoint at the expense of others; offering only win-lose solutions, usually enforced through a power position. This is often a win-lose situation.

While similar to smooth/accommodate, the conflict management technique being used in this scenario is collaborate/problem solve, which is used to get to the root of an issue so that it will lead to consensus and commitment.

-----
Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract provides for an indefinite quantity of goods or services at a stated lower and upper limit. IDIQ occurs within a fixed time period and is best applied to architectural, engineering, or IT engagements. 

-----
Work performance reports are physical or electronic representations of work performance information that is compiled into project documents. The performance of work performance reports is to generate decision making or raise issues, actions, or awareness. A few examples of work performance reports include status reports, memos, justifications, information notes, electronic dashboards, recommendations, and updates. 

-----
The critical path refers to the sequence or order of schedule activities that will make up the entire duration of a project. It represents the longest path through the entirety of the project, and typically, this path consists of every single activity that must be concluded from the kickoff to the ultimate conclusion of the project. Being the longest path, it is also the shortest possible duration of the project. The critical path will help the project manager to determine the length of time the project will take and where their attention would be best focused.

-----
Identify Stakeholders is the process of identifying project stakeholders regularly and analyzing and documenting relevant information regarding their interest, involvement, interdependencies, influence, and potential impact on project success. This process enables the project team to identify an appropriate focus to engage stakeholders. Identify Stakeholders is a process that will be performed throughout the project as necessary. 

Manage Stakeholder Engagement is a process of communicating and working with stakeholders to meet their needs/expectations, address issues as they occur, and foster appropriate stakeholder engagement and project activities throughout the project lifecycle.

Monitor Stakeholder Engagement is the process of monitoring project stakeholder relationships and tailoring strategies for engaging stakeholders through modification of engagement strategies and plans.

Plan Stakeholder Engagement is the process of developing approaches to involve project stakeholders based on their needs, expectations, interest, and potential impact on the project.

-----
The business case justifies the project and is used to determine whether the expected outcomes justify the required investment. The available budget is not used to support the justification for the project.

The business case is based on one or more of the following: market demand, organizational need, customer request, technology advancement, legal requirements, ecological impacts, or social need.

----
Commercial databases are databases that include standardized cost-estimating data and industry risk study information. Projects exist and operate in environments that may have an influence on them. These influences can have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the project. There are two major categories of influences: Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs) and Organizational Process Assets (OPAs).

Enterprise environmental factors originate from the environment outside of the project and often outside of the enterprise. They may have an impact at the organizational, portfolio, program, or project level. They can be internal or external to the organization. EEFs are considered inputs to many project management processes, specifically for most Planning processes.

----
Program managers manage groups of projects that are put together because managing them collectively gives benefit opportunities that do not exist for the projects on an individual basis. 

Project manager is incorrect, as it is a role that manages projects individually, not as groups. Portfolio manager is incorrect because it is a role that manages groups of projects to achieve strategic goals. Multi-project manager is incorrect, as it is not a real role. 

----
There are 5 power source of Project Manager:
1. Expert Power
2. Information Power
3. Social Power
4. Reference Power
5. Legitimate Power: A PM work as a team's leader, who decide and give a demand to ask team members work as his/her request.
  - Positional Power is a sub type of Legitimate Power

Interpersonal and team skills used in the Develop Team process include conflict management, influencing, motivation, negotiation, and team building.

A key action of Conduct Procurements is receiving presentations from various sellers. Presentations from sellers can be given as demos or during a bidder conference.

Requesting changes, reporting performance, and reviewing cost submittals are all key actions of Control Procurements.

The cost baseline is an element of the Project Management Plan that may be updated as a result of the Control Procurements process, not an organizational process asset update.

Agreement is used to define initial intentions for a project

The stakeholder register provides details on the project participants and their interests in the project. Names, titles, and business interests of all known participants make up this register.

The stakeholder register is considered an output for the Identify Stakeholders process and should include information such as:
Identification information: name, organizational position, location and contact details, and role on the project
Assessment information: Major requirements, expectations, potential for influencing project outcomes, and the phase of the project lifecycle where the stakeholder has the most influence or impact
Stakeholder classification: Internal/external, impact/influence/power/interest, upward/downward/outward/sideward, or any other classification model chosen by the project manager

When evaluating project team members using a multi-criteria analysis tool, influence is not a factor. The criteria used to score team members include availability, cost, ability, experience, knowledge, skills, attitude, and international factors.

The Validate Scope process is the process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project deliverables.

Stakeholders' expectations and risk thresholds is not an organizational process asset that may influence the Monitor and Control Project Work process. It is an enterprise environmental factor.

The cost performance index is not one of the seven basic quality tools. It is the measure of the cost efficiency of budgeted resources.

Payback period is best described as the length of time required to recoup the cost of a project.

Stakeholder mapping/representation is a data representation technique that can be used to group stakeholders by their qualifications. Power/interest grids and salience models are both classification tools that could help the project manager determine his or her communication level with the stakeholder.

--------
There are 3 categories of risks in the risk breakdown structure (RBS):
1. Technical Risk
2. Management Risk
3. Commercial Risk
4. External Risk

Regulatory and legislation risks are considered external risks, as they are outside the control of the organization

--------
The Conduct Procurement process is the process of obtaining seller responses, selecting a seller, and awarding a contract.

The Plan Procurement Management process handles documenting procurement decisions, specifying the approach, and identifying potential sellers. 

The Control Procurements process is responsible for managing procurement relationships, monitoring contract performance, and making changes as needed.

--------
A delayed project is not an example of why a project may be closed prematurely. Aborted projects, canceled projects, and projects with critical situations are all examples of projects that may be closed prematurely.

---------
The project exit criteria section of the project charter explains what conditions are to be met in order to close a project phase.

The business case section of the project charter explains why the project is being done.

The high-level project risks section of the project charter explains what the potential threats and opportunities are for the project.

The measurable project objectives section of the project charter explains how the project ties into the organization's strategic goals.

--------
The Schedule Performance Index (SPI) is a measure of schedule efficiency expressed as the ratio of earned value to planned value

--------
Quality improvement methods:
+ Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) (aka. Deming Cycle or Shewhart Cycle) and Six Sigma are both methods for continual improvement which can improve the quality of project management and the quality of the end product, service, or result.

+ Total quality management (TCM) and mutual benefit is incorrect as mutual benefit is not a method of quality improvement, it refers to an emerging trend in quality management having to do with partnerships with suppliers.

+ Lean Six Sigma and attribute sampling is incorrect as attribute sampling is not a method of quality improvement, it refers to a method of sampling for testing quality.

-------
The Develop Team process within the Project Resource Management knowledge area uses virtual teams. Virtual teams are also found in the Acquire Resources process.

------
Identify all possible stakeholders, analyze the impact or support each stakeholder may generate, and evaluate how each stakeholder may react or respond to various situations

-------
Identify all possible stakeholders, analyze the impact or support each stakeholder may generate, and evaluate how each stakeholder may react or respond to various situations

-------
When managing remote teams, it is often challenging to find a time for meetings when all team members can be available during their normal working hours, especially when operating in different time zones. Until a resolution can be found, this is an issue that should be appropriately logged in the issue log.

-------
Change control procedures and processes are part of the organizational process assets under the Perform Integrated Change Control process

-------
Obtaining the customer's formal acceptance or formal sign-off should help prevent them from asking for additional scope to be added to a project after the project team has been released to work on other projects. The formal acceptance and formal sign-off from the customer denote that the customer agrees the project is finished. This is called accepted deliverables.

-------
A path convergence is a relationship in which a schedule activity has more than one predecessor.

A path divergence is a relationship in which a schedule activity has more than one successor. 

A lead is the amount of time a successor activity can be advanced. 

A lag is the amount of time a successor activity can be delayed.

------
PMI Talent Triangle is a set of 3 fields combined as a skill framework:
+ Strategic and business management skills can also be defined as the skills needed to effectively apply project management knowledge to deliver desired outcomes for projects.

+ Leadership skills refer to skills used to motivate and guide teams of people toward a goal. 

+ Technical project management skills refer to the technical aspects of performing one's role.

Management skills are not part of the PMI Talent Triangle, but management refers to a style which differs from leadership in key ways. 

-------
A business case describes the project's objectives.

A project charter is a document that formally authorizes the project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities.

A project management plan describes how a project will be executed, monitored, and controlled. 

Organizational process assets are the plans, processes, policies, procedures, and knowledge bases that are specific to and used by the performing organization

------
An existing philosophy or accepted business practice within a company is an example of organizational culture. 
Organizational culture, infrastructure, personnel administration, and marketplace conditions are all examples of enterprise environmental factors that could impact the Plan Scope Management process.

Historical information and policies and procedures are examples of organizational process assets that could influence the Plan Scope Management process.

------
After the project manager has finished all of the technical work for the project, he still needs to complete the lessons learned. Lessons learned and knowledge gained throughout the project are transferred to the lessons learned repository for use by future projects.

Collecting the requirements and creating the work breakdown structure are both done in the Planning process group, and the project manager is now in the closing process group. The validate scope action is done in the Monitoring and Controlling process group.

------
Knowledge is commonly split into two types:

Explicit (knowledge that can readily be codified using words, pictures, and numbers)
Tacit (knowledge that is personal and difficult to express, such as belief, insights, experience, and "know-how")

-------
The most common examples of leadership styles include, but are not limited to:
+ Laissez-faire: Interpreted as “hands-off”, this project manager’s leadership style tends to just let their team lead themselves. Teams are left to make decisions, set goals, and implement their own ideas in completing the assigned tasks.
+ Transactional: This style focuses on goals, feedback, and ways to determine the rewards a person gets. A project manager with a transactional style will usually be rigid in implementing rules, processes, and procedures. They will even implement something called reward and punishment so that the team is always disciplined in implementing the values it has created.
+ Servant leader: A project manager with this style usually has traits such as: focus on others, growth, learning, shared prosperity, relationship orientation, and team collaboration.
+ Transformational: This leadership style has characteristics such as: empowering the team through ideal attributes and behaviors, inspirational motivation, encouraging innovation and creativity, and individual consideration. The main characteristic of the transformational leadership style is inspiration.
+ Charismatic: The main characteristics of a leader with a charismatic style include: high energy, enthusiasm, strong belief, and self-confidence. These personality traits then carry persuasive power to the team or its followers.
+ Interactional: A combination of transactional, transformational, and charismatic. Project managers with an interactional style consider variables such as the work environment, corporate culture, market challenges, conflict and complexity, and the influence of leaders on the business.

-------
Tailoring project management to a project is the selection of appropriate processes, inputs, tools, techniques, outputs, and life cycle phases, which the project manager collaborates with the project team, sponsor, or organizational management to decide. 
Tailoring is necessary because each project is unique and should consider the constraints of scope, schedule, cost, resources, quality, and risk. The project manager should record the impacts of tailoring during Closing, which includes obtaining acceptance, conducting reviews, documenting lessons learned, updating assets, archiving project documents, closing procurement activities, and releasing resources.

-------
A stakeholder engagement assessment matrix is a useful tool for determining stakeholder engagement levels. Gaps between current and desired levels can be identified, and actions to close these gaps can be determined using expert judgment. Stakeholder engagement levels can be classified as:
+ Unaware: unaware of the project and potential impacts
+ Resistant: aware of the project but are resistant to any changes that may occur as a result of the outcomes of the project
+ Neutral: aware of the project but are neither supportive nor unsupportive
+ Supportive: aware of the project and supportive of its outcomes
+Leading: aware of the project and are actively engaged in ensuring project success

-------
Verification is the evaluation of whether or not a product, service, or system complies with a regulation, requirement, specification, or imposed condition. It is often an internal process; therefore, the responsibility for verification would fall on the buyer, to ensure the seller provided the deliverables according to the accepted requirements.

-------
Plan Stakeholder Engagement is the process of developing appropriate approaches to effectively engage stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle, based on the analysis of their needs, interests, and potential impact on project success.

-------
PMO's responsibility: Standardize project governance and enable sharing of resources

Standardize project governance and enable sharing of resources is correct. While the other options may be part of a PMO's role within an organization, standardizing project-related governance and sharing of resources is common to all PMO types.

Conduct and publish performance reviews is incorrect, although that might be part of a PMO's role. Support organizational strategic alignment is incorrect, again, though it may be part of a PMO's role, it is not required of all PMOs. Enforce compliance is incorrect as certain types of PMO structures may enforce compliance, but it is not true of every PMO.

--------
Define activities , the key benefit is to decompose work packages inti schedule activities

--------
When creating reports for government bodies, the project manager should use formal communication.

Formal communication is a type of communication that follows a set structure and uses official language. It is typically used in professional settings, such as when communicating with government bodies, and is often necessary for legal or regulatory reasons.

Using formal communication ensures that the report is clear, concise, and professional, and helps to avoid misunderstandings or confusion. It also demonstrates respect for the recipient and their position, and can help to establish a positive relationship with the government body.
