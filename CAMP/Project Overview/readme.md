An adaptive lifecycle project => Agile methology => Servant leadership type
Agile Manifesto: Focus on the delivery of functionality to achieve business value
Agile teams are cross-functional and rely on the knowledge of the group to get the work done

The types of PMOs are supportive, controlling, and directive. Indirective is a made-up PMO. 
A controlling PMO offers support and requires compliance through various means
A controlling project management office supports the project through frameworks and methodologies.

Trend analysis should be used when needing to examine the past results of the project to see if its performance is improving or deteriorating. A trend analysis uses mathematical models to forecast future outcomes based on historical results. 

The status report should be used when needing to know where the project stands regarding the performance measurement baseline. 

The forecasting report should be used when needing to review the project's future status and performance. 

Variance analysis should be used when needing to compare the project's actual results to its baselines.

To Complete Performance Index (TCP) is a measure of the cost performance that must be achieved with the remaining resources to meet a specified management goal expressed as the ratio of the cost to finish the outstanding work to the budget available.
To calculate the efficiency that must be maintained to complete on plan, use the following formula:

TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC)

+ TCPI> 1.0 is harder to complete
+ TCPI = 1.0 is same to complete
+ TCPI< 1.0 is easier to complete

To calculate the efficiency that must be maintained to complete the current EAC, use the following formula:

TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (EAC - AC)

+ TCPI> 1.0 is harder to complete
+ TCPI = 1.0 is same to complete
+ TCPI < 1.0 is easier to complete

Return on Investment (ROI) is a measure of the amount of financial return compared to the cost. ROI is often part of the decision-making process to proceed with a project. It is important to understand that ROI may be different at different times during the lifecycle of a project. However, measuring ROI throughout the project enables the team to evaluate if they should continue organizational resource investments.
